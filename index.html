    <p>A guide to Final Fantasy XIV</p>
    <p>For the final project I will design a website that will describe a brief overview of the game Final Fantasy XIV ( 14) and specifically try to engage aspiring players to learn more about one of the roles of the game, the Tank.</p>

    <p>Final Fantasy XIV is an online role playing game that has over 10 million accounts and perhaps active players worldwide. It is of the Fantasy gene that contains magic, dragons, swords, axes, and many other
      elements that you would find in perhaps a Lord of the Rings movie. Many people see it as a competitor to the popular
      World of Warcraft games. Oddly enough in recent times there have been what feels like an exodus of players from The World of Warcraft that are making the switch over to Final Fantasy XIV. As such I have found an increasing number of new players who don't quite understand the basics and fundamentals of a game in this Genre. This genre is called an MMO or MMORPG for short.
      MMORPG stands for Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. In these games you create a character and adventure throught the world either solo or with a companion and can do all sorts of exciting and ever changing content. Through a website, I aim to enrich and enlighten aspiring players, especially tanks to step up and become the protectors of the realm. That and its hard to find enough of these players, alot of people are intimidated by the responsibilities this role requires! I am not stating that "tanking" is the most difficult role, rather it can be a bit frightening when everyone's life is on the line and that responsibility rests on your shoulders. Best not slip up or catch cold feet on the job! But hey no pressure right ? </p>
