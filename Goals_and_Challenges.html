    <h1>Goals and Challenges</h1>
    <p>Simple is not always easy!</p>
    <ul>

    <li> Some goals that I see along the way to making this page are ease of access. Because of the nature of the game and the variety in player types, it will be hard to tackle every entry point for all types of players. One goal that I have is to make the information in the guide as easy to understand as possible, such that someone who takes the time to sit and read through can walk away with a little more than basic understanding of the tanking classes and how to play them.</li>

    <li> Another challenge that I see along the way is creating a visual guide to go along with the text. One goal I have with this is perhaps to record in game footage and converting the video into a gif file. Then I can have the gif accompany the point that I'm trying to illustrate within the context of what is going on at the time.</li>
    <li> Something that I realized might pose a problem is that Final Fantasy XIV is playable on the Play Station 4 with a controller. The PC client also has controller support, as such some players might not know how to operate the game on a controller. I made the switch to controller and at first it was very difficult and the button layout was unlike any game I had played before. After I got the hang of it, it worked extremely well, but there's a big learning curve that goes along with it.  The Challenge here is that someone might want to play the game, play a tank, and also be on a controller gamepad for pc or Playstation 4. The game has customization features and a way I feel that I could surpass that challenge would be to give a video tutorial on how the controller works. </li>

    <li> The vocabulary in an MMORPG type game. New players to the genre or to this game might not be familiar with the words that are frequently used. Another situation is that Final Fantasy XIV has words that are exclusive to  this game. While that may sound confusing at first, a quick run through of terms that might come up will help alleviate that issue. As such a goal that I can add onto this is to make a page dedicated to terms and words that are a bit unusual, and to organize it  by category. </li>

    <li> A challenge that I see myself having in regards to putting the page together is in regards to making the page look interactive and fun to read. The last thing anyone wants to do is slog through text that is unpleasant to look at. A goal that I can set is to look at  what some of my research sites have done aesthetically and incorporate those styles, or something similar of my own making into the final website. </li> </ul>
