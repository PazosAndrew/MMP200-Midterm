    <h1>Survey of the field</h1>

    <p> So for this proposal I've chosen the game Final Fantasy XIV. Now who might be interested in a site like this ? I feel that a large number of the gaming commmunity have heard of an RPG game before. The difference with an online RPG is that you can join up with friends and take on obstacles together. As far as who plays this kind of game? Well thats not easy to answer and even harder to find data on. Generally with MMO's the average player is at least in the mid teenage years to an adult. The premium games, FFXIV included, have a monthly subscription fee. The cost is one barrier of entry that might prevent a young child from playing the game. Through experience I have come across some players even in their late  50's playing the game. FFXIV isn't just combat, magic and dragons. There are a plethora of other things a player can do such as fishing, mining, gathering herbs and lumber. In addition to hunting and gathering, the  player has the option to pickup a tradeskill such as blacksmithing, or the culinary arts, even alchemy is a choice. All of these options give players more variety and that can attract a different demographic all together.A major component of Final  Fantasy XIV is its combat and the encounters that are available to players.  While I don't consider myself the leading expert in theory crafting or number crunching and maximizing performance. However I do consider my knowledge
      of the game and its systems to be above the average player.  The game can be incredibly complex and has layers upon layers of optimization and customization. All of this can be very daunting for someone who is
      perhaps new to the genre or to the game itself. I briefly mentioned World of Warcraft earlier and while it has a similar system, the differences are enough that even an expert could be hard pressed to make
      an error or not know how to increase their performance. In these games, depending on the content you are doing, everyone has a<b> role</b> to play. </p>
