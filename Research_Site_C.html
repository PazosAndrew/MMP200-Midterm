    <h1>Research Site C</h1>
    <p> <a href="https://ffxiv.eorzeacollection.com/"> Eorzea Collection </a></p>
    <p> Last and certainly not least of my research sites is the website https://ffxiv.eorzeacollection.com/. A couple of features that this site contains are the color scheme and ease of access. At the top there is a nav bar that really gets straight into the heart of the page and that is something called glamour sets. In Final Fantasy XIV there is a feature that allows you to visually change the appearance of a piece of equipment you have into something else that is compatible with that type of piece. For example if you have a shortsword that is powerful, but you have in your possession a weaker sword that looks better visually, you can put the apperance of the old item onto the new one, while keeping the statistics and properties of the stronger weapon. This goes for body armor, shields, helmets etc. As such, you can customize your appearance a GREAT deal in this game. A large majority of the playerbase will attempt to do a particular piece of content, even if its outdated just for the sake of obtaining an item for visual purposes only.  Back to the website. Eorzeacollection is a website where players can submit their glamour sets for other players to see and perhaps go for a particular "look". There are a great many players who also find ways to make their characters look like other characters from different series. Here's an example of a player using items within the game to make a " glamour set" that is very much akin to Link from the "Legend of Zelda" series. </p>

      <div class="col-sm">
       <img src="Assets\Images\linkglam.png" class="img-fluid" />
      <p> A feature that the developers of the game are constantly improving upon is the screenshot feature. The developers have included within the game, a mode where you can position the in game camera in all sorts of angles and apply some filters to take very interesting screenshots with awesome effects. Why does this matter? Well if you're in a virtual world, why not take a photo once in a while of your adventures? It couldn't hurt. All in all Eorzea collection does a good job of showcasing an aspect of the game that many players thoroughly enjoy. Every couple of months Square Enix releases new content. Along with that content is new  pieces of gear or equipment. Eorzea collection fills a very useful niche in that regard. On the front page they have a list of the newest equipment.
