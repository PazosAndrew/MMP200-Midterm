    <h1>Research Site A</h1>


    <p><a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/FF14_Wiki">FFXIV Consolegameswiki </a></p>
    <p>While looking up information on various aspects of the game, one of the websites that I often frequented and preffered is the FFXIV.consolegameswiki.com page.   The UI while nothing too extravagant is pretty straight forward to a wiki page and makes accessing snippets of information readily available. The page is divided up into categories with a menu bar at the left, as well as  having a search option at the top right. The wiki does have a handful of articles on various aspects of the game but the guides are very barebones and provide only a very basic understanding. Not to mention it is all text based. I believe that a combination of visual imagery along with text, and perhaps even sound would make for an effective guide. The webpage does make good use of sectioning elements to divide the content up into separate groups to find your way around easier. I'd like to try and incorporate some of that into my page.  Another feature of the site that I enjoy is the news feed near the top right corner. Although it doesn't seem to have been updated since November, I think a news feed for a game of this caliber is important to see. Something cool that I came across was a glossary-esque page that had terms that are commonly found in MMO's. This is useful because as a long time player, I'm a bit more familiar with the jargon thats associated with these games. Its easy to forget that once I had no idea what some of these terms even meant. A glossary or dictionary section could be something I include in my final project. Perhaps as a way to ease things for someone who is brand new to the genre.
